Hi there ✨

I'm Samuel. I'm about to graduate in Industrial Automation (Technical) at ETEC in São Paulo, Brazil.  
I love figuring out new things and turning my ideas into code or physical projects, using electronics and a little programming.  
Right now, I'm working on improving my C++ skills and my English too.

**• FUN FACTS:**  
- I don’t like carrots  
- Dragon Ball is currently my favorite anime
